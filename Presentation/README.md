# Quantum Neuronal Networks and Quantum Variational Circuits

This repository contains a brief introduction to **Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs)** and **Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs)**, exploring how quantum computing techniques can be integrated into machine learning models, especially in the NISQ era. The development of this topic was done by:

- Juan Esteban Huertas Serrano
- Cesar Arthuro Lemos Silva
- Omar David Toledo Leguizamón

## Topics Covered

- Why quantum computing for machine learning  
- Parameterized quantum gates  
- Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs)  
- Data encoding methods (basis, amplitude, angle)  
- Ansatz design and circuit structure  
- Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs)  
- Hardware-efficient, tensor-tree, and convolutional QNN architectures  
- Measurements and expectation values  
- Training with the parameter-shift rule  
- Usage scenarios for VQCs and QNNs

The presentation was done via some [slides](https://www.canva.com/design/DAG5kAHUauk/SN3b4NEUGFo2HOrHLwiZ7w/view) and a practical example available here.
