## Decrypting Secret Content

Some content is protected and can only be accessed by authorized users. The encrypted file is `secret.enc`.

To decrypt and extract the protected content:

1. Obtain the password from the repository owner (authorization required).
2. Run the decryption script:

	```bash
	python decrypt.py
	```

	You will be prompted to enter the password.

3. If the password is correct, the script will decrypt `secret.enc` and extract its contents to the appropriate folders.

**Note:** The password is confidential and should not be shared. Unauthorized access is prohibited.
